# Tasks: Player Research

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-player-research/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This feature includes comprehensive testing as specified in the constitution (unit tests, e2e tests) and existing test standards.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- All paths use the existing NestJS/React structure

## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### User Story Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundation) → Phase 3 (US1) ✅ MVP
                                        ↓
                                        Phase 4 (US2)
                                        ↓
                                        Phase 5 (US3)
                                        ↓
                                        Phase 6 (Background Jobs)
                                        ↓
                                        Phase 7 (Polish)
```

**Independent Stories**: US1, US2, US3 can be implemented in any order after Phase 2 is complete. However, US2 builds naturally on US1 (adds scores to existing search), and US3 builds on US1 (saves existing filters).

**Suggested Order**: US1 → US2 → US3 (as prioritized in spec.md)

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 3 (US1) - After T019 complete**:
- Run in parallel: T020, T021, T022, T023 (backend endpoints)
- Run in parallel: T024, T025, T026, T027 (frontend components)
- Run in parallel: T032, T033, T034, T035, T036 (all test tasks)

**Phase 4 (US2) - After T038 complete**:
- Run in parallel: T042, T043, T044 (backend optimizations)
- Run in parallel: T045, T046, T047, T051 (frontend components)
- Run in parallel: T053, T054, T055, T056, T057 (all test tasks)

**Phase 5 (US3) - After T060 complete**:
- Run in parallel: T061, T062, T063, T064 (backend CRUD endpoints)
- Run in parallel: T068, T069, T073, T074, T075 (frontend components)
- Run in parallel: T076, T077, T078, T079, T080 (all test tasks)

**Phase 7 (Polish)**:
- Run all tasks in parallel (T089-T102)

### MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (US1 only)

This delivers:
- ✅ Player search and filtering by position, team, date range
- ✅ Paginated results with player details
- ✅ Full backend API and frontend UI
- ✅ Complete test coverage for core functionality

**Value Delivered**: Users can research players and narrow down results using standard filters. This is the foundational capability that US2 and US3 build upon.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Complete Phase 1 & 2 first** (setup and foundation) - ~15 tasks
2. **Implement US1 completely** (MVP) - ~21 tasks
3. **Validate US1 works independently** before moving to US2
4. **Implement US2 completely** (scoring) - ~21 tasks
5. **Implement US3 completely** (saved searches) - ~23 tasks
6. **Add background job** - ~8 tasks
7. **Polish and optimize** - ~14 tasks

**Total**: 102 tasks

**Estimated Timeline**:
- Phase 1 & 2: 2-3 days
- US1 (MVP): 3-4 days
- US2: 3-4 days
- US3: 3-4 days
- Phase 6 & 7: 2-3 days
- **Total**: ~13-18 days for full feature
