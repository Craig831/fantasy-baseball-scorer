# Tasks: Player Research (Updated for New Requirements)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-player-research/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/player-research-api.yaml

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification. Test tasks are excluded per specification guidelines.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Note**: This tasks.md reflects the UPDATED specification requirements:
- Horizontal filter panel with Apply/Clear button controls
- Dynamic column display based on scoring configuration
- Filter state management (pending/applied pattern)
- Updated API parameters (statisticType, positions array, season)
- New response format (totalPoints, pointsPerGame, teamAbbr)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md project structure:
- **Backend**: `backend/src/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`
- **Tests**: `backend/tests/`, `frontend/tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately (6 tasks)
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories (9 tasks)
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational completion
  - Can proceed in parallel if staffed
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete (17 tasks)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (34 tasks)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 player listing but scoring is independent (29 tasks)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Operates on US1 filters but saves independently (14 tasks)

### Within Each User Story

- Backend API updates before frontend API calls
- DTOs before controllers
- Hooks before components
- Components before integration
- Core functionality before accessibility
- Core functionality before responsive design

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup**: All 6 tasks can run in parallel
- **Foundational**: T007-T015 can run in parallel after schema updates
- **Within US1**: T016-T019 (backend), T020-T026 (filter panel), T038-T045 (accessibility) can run in parallel at appropriate stages
- **Within US2**: T050-T055 (backend), T056-T065 (columns), T074-T077 (accessibility) can run in parallel
- **Within US3**: T079-T084 (backend), T085-T090 (frontend) can run in parallel
- **Polish**: Most tasks (T093-T108) can run in parallel

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (9 tasks) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (34 tasks)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Test horizontal filter panel with Apply/Clear buttons
   - Verify filters don't execute until Apply clicked
   - Test keyboard navigation and screen reader
   - Verify team abbreviations and name formatting
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**Total MVP tasks**: 49 tasks

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phase 1 + 2): 15 tasks → Schema and API updates ready
2. **MVP** (+ User Story 1): 34 tasks → Horizontal filter panel working (49 total)
3. **Scoring** (+ User Story 2): 29 tasks → Add dynamic columns and scores (78 total)
4. **Saved Searches** (+ User Story 3): 14 tasks → Add save/load with v2 schema (92 total)
5. **Polish** (Phase 6): 17 tasks → Production-ready (109 total)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Foundation Together** (Phase 1 + 2): Complete setup
2. **After Foundational**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Filter Panel)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Scoring) - can start after T015
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Saved Searches) - can start after T015
3. Stories integrate independently
4. **Team Together**: Polish phase

## Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 109
- **Setup Phase**: 6 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 9 tasks (BLOCKS all stories)
- **User Story 1** (MVP): 34 tasks (Horizontal Filter Panel with Apply/Clear)
- **User Story 2**: 29 tasks (Dynamic Columns & Scoring)
- **User Story 3**: 14 tasks (Saved Searches v2)
- **Polish Phase**: 17 tasks

---

## Notes

- This tasks.md reflects the UPDATED specification with horizontal filter panel and dynamic columns
- Previous implementation had vertical filter panel with auto-apply - this is being redesigned
- Filter state management uses pending/applied pattern (not auto-apply)
- Dynamic columns filter based on scoring configuration (not fixed columns)
- SavedSearch schema updated to filterVersion 2 (statisticType, positions array, season)
- Player names formatted as "Lastname, Firstname"
- Team abbreviations are 3-letter codes (NYY, LAA, COL)
- Tests not included per specification (no explicit test requirement)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) is critical per constitution
- [P] tasks can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- [Story] label maps to user stories (US1, US2, US3)
