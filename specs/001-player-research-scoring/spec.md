## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Account Management (Priority: P1)

As a fantasy sports enthusiast, I need to create an account and manage my profile so that I can access personalized research and scoring features.

**Why this priority**: Without user accounts, there's no way to persist scoring settings or lineup configurations. This is the foundational requirement that enables all other features per the constitution's "User account as core identity" principle.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an account, logging in, updating profile settings, and logging out. Delivers a complete authentication system that can stand alone.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a new user on the signup page, **When** I provide email and password meeting requirements, **Then** my account is created and I am logged in
2. **Given** I am a registered user on the login page, **When** I enter valid credentials, **Then** I am authenticated and redirected to the dashboard
3. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to account settings, **Then** I can view and update my email, password, and privacy preferences
4. **Given** I am logged in to account settings, **When** I request account deletion, **Then** I receive confirmation and my account and data are permanently deleted
5. **Given** I have forgotten my password, **When** I use the password reset flow, **Then** I receive a secure reset link and can set a new password
6. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I enable multi-factor authentication, **Then** subsequent logins require my second factor

### User Story 2 - Scoring Settings Configuration (Priority: P2)

As a user, I need to define and save custom scoring settings so that player performance metrics reflect my league's unique scoring rules.

**Why this priority**: Custom scoring is a core differentiator. Without it, the research and lineup features would provide generic data that doesn't match users' actual league needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, creating a scoring configuration (e.g., "PPR League 2025"), defining point values for various statistics, saving the configuration, and verifying it persists across sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to scoring settings, **Then** I can create a new scoring configuration with a custom name
2. **Given** I am creating a scoring configuration, **When** I view the configuration form, **Then** I see baseball-specific statistical categories (batting and pitching stats)
3. **Given** I am editing a scoring configuration, **When** I assign point values to statistics (e.g., Home Run = 4 pts, Strikeout = 1 pt), **Then** the values are saved with my configuration
4. **Given** I have multiple scoring configurations, **When** I view my configurations list, **Then** I can select one as my active default configuration
5. **Given** I have a saved scoring configuration, **When** I edit and save changes, **Then** the updated values are persisted
6. **Given** I have a scoring configuration, **When** I delete it, **Then** it is removed and any lineups using it revert to standard scoring

---

### User Story 3 - Player Research with Filters (Priority: P3)

As a user, I need to search and filter players based on performance metrics so that I can identify optimal players for my lineup using my custom scoring settings.

**Why this priority**: Research capabilities are essential for informed decision-making but require scoring settings to be meaningful. This builds on P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with a configured scoring system, applying filters (position, team, date range), and viewing sorted player performance results with calculated scores.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in with an active scoring configuration, **When** I access the player research page, **Then** I see a searchable list of players with calculated scores
2. **Given** I am on the player research page, **When** I apply filters (position, team, opponent, date range), **Then** the player list updates to match my criteria
3. **Given** I am viewing filtered results, **When** I sort by any column (name, position, score, specific stats), **Then** the list reorders accordingly
4. **Given** I am viewing a player in the research results, **When** I click on the player, **Then** I see detailed statistics and scoring breakdown
5. **Given** I am viewing player research, **When** I change my active scoring configuration, **Then** all displayed scores recalculate immediately
6. **Given** I have applied multiple filters, **When** I clear all filters, **Then** the full player list returns

### User Story 4 - Lineup Creation and Scoring (Priority: P4)

As a user, I need to create sport-specific lineups and see total projected scores so that I can optimize my fantasy team selections.

**Why this priority**: Lineup management is the primary use case but requires both account management (P1) and scoring settings (P2) to function meaningfully. Research (P3) enhances lineup decisions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new lineup, adding players to the lineup (up to 25), viewing the total projected score based on selected scoring settings, and saving the lineup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I create a new lineup, **Then** I can name it and select a scoring configuration
2. **Given** I am editing a lineup, **When** I view the lineup slots, **Then** I can add up to 25 players in any combination
3. **Given** I am editing a lineup, **When** I search for a player and add them to the lineup, **Then** their projected score displays and contributes to the lineup total
4. **Given** I have a player in the lineup, **When** I remove them or swap them with another player, **Then** the lineup total score updates
5. **Given** I have created a lineup, **When** I save it, **Then** it persists and appears in my saved lineups list
6. **Given** I have multiple saved lineups, **When** I view my lineups list, **Then** I can open, edit, duplicate, or delete any lineup
7. **Given** I am viewing a saved lineup, **When** all games have concluded, **Then** I can see actual scores vs. projected scores calculated post-game

---

### User Story 5 - Mobile-Optimized Interface (Priority: P5)

As a mobile user, I need a responsive interface optimized for small screens so that I can research players and manage lineups on my phone.

**Why this priority**: Per the constitution's "Mobile-first approach" principle, mobile optimization is mandatory. However, it's prioritized after core functionality is validated on at least one platform.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the application on a mobile device and completing key workflows (login, configure scoring, search players, create lineup) with touch-optimized controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I access any page, **Then** the layout adapts to my screen size with readable text and accessible touch targets
2. **Given** I am using a mobile device, **When** I navigate the app, **Then** I can access all features through a mobile-optimized navigation menu
3. **Given** I am on mobile viewing player research, **When** I apply filters, **Then** I use mobile-friendly controls (dropdowns, date pickers, toggles)
4. **Given** I am creating a lineup on mobile, **When** I add players, **Then** I can use swipe gestures or tap controls to manage the lineup
5. **Given** I am on a slow mobile connection, **When** pages load, **Then** I see progressive loading indicators and core content loads within 3 seconds

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to create a lineup without first configuring scoring settings? (System should prompt user to create scoring configuration first or offer a default)
- How does the system handle player data updates during an active game? (Real-time updates should reflect in research but not change saved lineup projections)
- What happens when a user tries to add the same player multiple times in a lineup? (System should prevent duplicate players in the same lineup)
- How does the system handle deleted or invalid players in saved lineups? (Flag the lineup as invalid and prompt user to replace the player)
- What happens when a user's scoring configuration is deleted while lineups reference it? (Lineups should revert to standard scoring or prompt user to select new configuration)
- How does the system handle concurrent edits to the same lineup from multiple devices? (Last write wins with timestamp, or implement optimistic locking with conflict notification)
- What happens when a user exceeds storage limits for saved lineups? (Enforce reasonable limits and notify user, allow deletion of old lineups)
- What happens when a lineup reaches 25 players? (UI disables "Add Player" functionality and optionally displays a simple informational message like "Lineup full (25/25)")

## Out of Scope *(for this feature)*

The following are explicitly NOT included in this initial feature but may be considered for future iterations:

- Social features (sharing lineups, following other users, leagues)
- Draft assistance or recommendations
- Trade analysis or suggestions
- Historical season comparison tools
- Advanced analytics (projections, trends, machine learning predictions)
- Integration with third-party fantasy platforms (ESPN, Yahoo, etc.)
- Live chat or customer support features
- Payment processing or premium subscriptions
- Mobile native apps (starting with responsive web, mobile web only)
- Push notifications
- Offline mode capabilities

## Technical Constraints

Per the constitution:
- **API-first development**: All features must be exposed via RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- **Mobile-first approach**: UI designed for mobile before desktop scaling
- **WCAG compliance**: Must meet Level AA accessibility standards
- **Security**: MFA support, secure password management, encryption at rest for sensitive data
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing required
- **Cross-platform**: Web (modern browsers) and mobile web (iOS/Android) support required

## Dependencies and Assumptions

**Assumptions**:
- Baseball (MLB) player statistics data is available via MLB-StatsAPI (free/open source library)
- Focus is exclusively on baseball for MVP with architecture designed for future sport expansion
- Users have reliable internet connection (offline mode is out of scope)
- Email delivery service is available for verification and password reset flows

**External Dependencies**:
- MLB-StatsAPI (Python library for accessing MLB official statistics)
- Email delivery service (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES, Mailgun)
- Authentication library/service supporting MFA
- Database supporting relational data model with ACID guarantees
- Hosting infrastructure with monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Risks

1. **Data freshness**: Player statistics may lag behind live games depending on data provider SLA
2. **Scalability**: User-defined scoring requires per-user calculation which could impact performance at scale
3. **Data source availability**: Dependency on third-party baseball player data creates single point of failure
4. **Mobile performance**: Complex scoring calculations and large player datasets may impact mobile experience
5. **Future expansion**: Architecture must remain flexible enough to support additional sports without major refactoring

## Next Steps

1. Run `/speckit.clarify` to resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items
2. Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan, research findings, and API contracts
3. Run `/speckit.tasks` to create dependency-ordered task breakdown
4. Run `/speckit.checklist` to generate UX, security, and accessibility checklists
5. Run `/speckit.implement` to execute the implementation plan
