# Fantasy Baseball Scorer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User Experience (UX) and Interface (UI) Principles

- **User-centric design:** All features and design decisions MUST prioritize the user's needs,
  goals, and experience. The application MUST be intuitive and easy to use.
- **Accessibility first:** The application MUST meet or exceed WCAG (Web Content Accessibility
  Guidelines) standards. All users, regardless of ability, MUST be able to use the application
  effectively.
- **Mobile-first approach:** The user interface MUST be designed and optimized for mobile
  devices before scaling up to larger screen sizes.
- **Consistent design language:** The UI MUST use a single, consistent design system across
  all platforms (web and mobile) to ensure a coherent user experience.

**Rationale**: Prioritizing user experience ensures the application is usable, accessible, and
delightful across all devices and user abilities. Mobile-first design acknowledges primary
usage patterns while maintaining consistency across platforms.

### II. Functional Principles (User Accounts)

- **User account as core identity:** The user account is the central identity for all
  application features. All data and user interactions MUST be tied to a specific,
  authenticated user.
- **Simplified onboarding:** The account creation process MUST be as frictionless as possible,
  with clear steps and minimal required information at signup.
- **Secure authentication:** User authentication MUST use industry-standard, secure methods,
  including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and secure password management.
- **Granular account control:** Users MUST have full control over their account information,
  privacy settings, and data. This includes the right to view, update, or delete their data
  and account.

**Rationale**: User accounts provide secure identity management and personalization while
empowering users with control over their data. Simplified onboarding reduces friction while
maintaining security standards.

### III. Technical Principles

- **API-first development:** The application MUST be built on a robust, well-documented API.
  The web and mobile clients MUST both consume the same API, ensuring platform consistency.
- **Performance-driven:** The application MUST deliver a responsive and performant experience.
  This includes fast load times, smooth transitions, and efficient data usage.
- **Scalable architecture:** The system's architecture MUST be scalable to handle a growing
  user base and increasing data volume without sacrificing performance.
- **Cross-platform compatibility:** The application MUST function seamlessly on modern
  versions of major web browsers and the latest versions of iOS and Android.

**Rationale**: API-first development ensures consistency across platforms while enabling
future integrations. Performance and scalability are foundational to user satisfaction and
long-term viability.

### IV. Security Principles

- **Data privacy by design:** User data privacy MUST be a core consideration from the outset.
  We MUST only collect data that is necessary for the application's functionality.
- **Secure by default:** All user-facing features MUST have security considered as a top
  priority. This includes protecting against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and
  cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Regular security audits:** The codebase and infrastructure MUST undergo regular security
  reviews to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- **Secure data storage:** User information, especially sensitive data, MUST be stored
  securely using encryption and best-practice security measures.

**Rationale**: Security and privacy are non-negotiable requirements for protecting users and
maintaining trust. Proactive security practices reduce risk and ensure regulatory compliance.

### V. Operational Principles

- **Reliability and uptime:** The application MUST maintain a high level of uptime, with
  robust monitoring and alerting in place to address issues quickly.
- **Observability:** The system MUST be fully observable, providing insights into logs,
  metrics, and tracing to assist with debugging and performance optimization.
- **Auditable:** All changes and significant user actions related to data MUST be logged for
  auditing and compliance purposes.

**Rationale**: Operational excellence ensures users can rely on the application. Observability
enables rapid issue resolution, and auditability supports compliance and accountability.

## Guiding Questions

When evaluating any feature, design, or implementation decision, consider:

- Does this feature respect user privacy and data security?
- Is this design accessible to all users, including those with disabilities?
- Will this implementation perform well on both web and mobile clients?
- How does this feature contribute to a simple and intuitive user experience?
- Can this feature scale with a growing user base?

These questions MUST be addressed during the Constitution Check phase in plan.md. Any "No" or
uncertain answer requires explicit justification and mitigation strategy.

## Development Workflow

The project follows the Specify framework workflow using slash commands:

1. **Specification**: `/speckit.specify` creates spec.md with prioritized user stories
2. **Clarification**: `/speckit.clarify` resolves ambiguities (optional)
3. **Planning**: `/speckit.plan` generates plan.md and design artifacts
4. **Constitution Check**: Evaluate guiding questions during planning phase
5. **Task Generation**: `/speckit.tasks` creates tasks.md organized by user story
6. **Checklists**: `/speckit.checklist` generates feature-specific checklists (optional)
7. **Analysis**: `/speckit.analyze` validates cross-artifact consistency (optional)
8. **Implementation**: `/speckit.implement` executes tasks phase-by-phase

**Workflow rules**:
- Constitution Check in plan.md MUST explicitly address all five guiding questions
- Principles MUST be verified at specification, planning, and implementation phases
- Accessibility, security, and performance considerations MUST be addressed before
  implementation begins
- All checklists MUST be complete before implementation (or explicit approval required)

## Quality Gates

**Specification Gate**: Spec.md MUST include:
- User-centric acceptance scenarios
- Accessibility requirements identified
- Mobile-first considerations documented
- Security and privacy implications addressed

**Planning Gate**: Plan.md MUST include:
- Constitution Check with all guiding questions addressed
- API contracts defined in contracts/
- Performance goals and constraints specified
- Security measures documented in research.md
- Accessibility standards specified

**Implementation Gate**: Before marking feature complete:
- All accessibility standards met (WCAG compliance)
- API documentation complete and accurate
- Performance benchmarks achieved
- Security review passed
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- All tests passing (if testing specified)

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
- Documentation of rationale for the change
- Version bump following semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
  - **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible changes to core principles
  - **MINOR**: New principles added or existing principles expanded
  - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, or non-semantic refinements
- Review of dependent templates and documentation
- Sync Impact Report documenting all affected files

**Compliance**:
- All feature development MUST verify constitution compliance via Constitution Check
- Deviations from principles MUST be explicitly justified and documented in plan.md
- Constitution violations in code review are blocking issues
- Features that cannot satisfy guiding questions MUST be redesigned or rejected

**Runtime Guidance**:
- Use CLAUDE.md for Claude Code-specific development guidance
- Use this constitution for project-wide governance principles
- When guidance conflicts, constitution takes precedence
- For production deployments, operational principles MUST be verified

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-24 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-24
